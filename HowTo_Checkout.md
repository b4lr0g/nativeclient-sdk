## Native Client SDK has moved ##

The Native Client SDK itself has moved to the chromium repository. Instructions for building and testing the Native Client SDK itself are located in the [chromium repository](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/native_client_sdk/src/BUILDING.rst).

This repository is still used from some tools and applications that are  ancillary to the SDK itself and don't belong in the chromium repo.

## Prerequisites ##

You need to install [depot\_tools](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools) in order to use gclient.

## Checking Out ##

### Create a Project Directory ###

```
mkdir nativeclient-sdk
cd nativeclient-sdk
```

### Create a .gclient Configuration (git) ###
```
gclient config --name=src  https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/nativeclient-sdk.git
```

### Create a .gclient Configuration (svn) ###
```
gclient config http://nativeclient-sdk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src
```

### Sync to the repo ###
```
gclient sync
```

## Checking In (svn) ##

## Checking In (git) ##
